### 🏆 Enterprise Projects (Architecture & Design)
*Due to strict NDAs, source code is not public. Below are the architectural outcomes of my recent work.*

#### 🏢 Project 1: Multi-Region Data Lakehouse Migration
* **The Challenge:** A legacy on-premise Hadoop cluster was costing the company $50k/month and suffering from data latency of 24+ hours.
* **My Role:** Lead Architect.
* **The Solution:** Designed a hybrid-cloud architecture using **Azure Data Lake Gen2** and **Databricks**. Implemented an event-driven ingestion layer using **Kafka**.
* **The Outcome:**
    * Real-time data availability (latency reduced from 24h to <5s).
    * Operational costs reduced by **40%** via spot-instance auto-scaling.

#### 🛡️ Project 2: Zero-Trust DevSecOps Implementation
* **The Challenge:** The client (FinTech sector) failed a security audit due to hardcoded secrets and vulnerable container images.
* **My Role:** Senior DevOps Engineer.
* **The Solution:** Built a "Golden Image" pipeline using **Docker** and **Trivy** for scanning. Integrated **HashiCorp Vault** for dynamic secret injection into **Kubernetes (AKS)** pods.
* **The Outcome:**
    * Achieved **100% compliance** with ISO 27001 standards.
    * Automated security blocking in CI/CD, preventing 15+ critical vulnerabilities from reaching production.

#### ☁️ Project 3: High-Availability Disaster Recovery System
* **The Challenge:** Critical payment gateway had no automated failover, posing a risk of million-dollar losses during downtime.
* **My Role:** Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
* **The Solution:** Architected an Active-Passive failover strategy using **Terraform** to replicate infrastructure across Azure East/West regions.
* **The Outcome:**
    * Reduced Recovery Time Objective (RTO) from 4 hours to **15 minutes**.
    * Successfully survived a simulated chaos engineering attack with zero data loss.
